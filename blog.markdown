<h2>Sling Libraries</h2>

<h3>What is a sling library?</h3>
<p>A sling library is a bit like a book library, only for baby carriers! It provides families with the opportunity to try a selection of different baby carrier styles and brands, with guidance and support from a babywearing specialist. You can then hire a carrier (or two!) normally for a fixed period of 1 month. Most sling libraries will also provide help with your own carrier, for a small fee.</p>

<h3>Where are sling libraries held?</h3>
<p>Sling libraries are held in lots of different venues, including baby groups, soft plays, community centres, village halls and actual libraries! Some are in the same place every session, while others travel to multiple venues each month. During 2020 most libraries have had to temporarily stop running from venues, but most have continued to provide online support and hires, and some (like me!) are now returning to venues again.</p>

<h3>Who runs them?</h3>
<p>Sling libraries are generally run by parents who are passionate about babywearing and want to share their love and experience with other families! They have normally either undergone training in peer support, or more in depth consultancy training with an organisation like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sling.a.Baby">Slingababy</a>.</p>

<h3>What happens at a sling library?</h3>
<p>Some libraries offer drop in sessions, but most are currently operating a booking system for either single household fitting slots or small group sessions. Once you have booked you will likely receive an email with information about the session, including a reminder to register for any online hire systems to save time and paperwork on the day.</p>

<p>When you arrive, you will likely be warmly greeted by the session organiser, who may also introduce you to other families. They will check in with you about your carrying needs, and then demonstrate one or two carriers that might be suitable for you, before guiding you through using them yourself. You will then have the option of hiring one or more carriers to take home until the next session.</p>

<h3>Why use a sling library?</h3>
<p>There are a huge range of baby carriers available to buy, with a huge range of styles, fabrics, quality and prices! A baby carrier can be a big investment which you may well end up using even more than your buggy, so it’s worth seeking help to find one that works for you. A sling library is the perfect place to try different carriers to find the best fit for you before investing in your own. The support and fitting advice available at a sling library also generally far exceeds manufacturers’ instructions, ensuring any carrier you try is as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>Many libraries also offer free or discounted stretchy wrap fitting and hire for newborn babies, which is often exactly what you need to tide you over until your baby is big enough for other carriers or you’ve had chance to investigate other options.</p>

<p>Sling library sessions are also a great place for both you and your little one to make new friends in your community.</p>

<h3>Why do I have to pay for library sessions and hires?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately there is little to no funding available to help sling libraries run. Even when libraries are run by volunteers, they rely on the income generated from fitting and hire fees to cover venue hire, buying carriers, carrier maintenance and cleaning, along with in depth training and professional development costs and much more! At Forest of Dean Slings I volunteer my time around working a ‘proper job’, but for many babywearing consultants this IS their proper job, and they therefore need and deserve to generate a sufficient income. In the words of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coorieinwithlove/">Coorie in with love</a>:</p>

<blockquote>This is my business, my job that pays my mortgage, clothes for my children and food on our table.</blockquote>

<h3>How do I find my nearest library?</h3>
<p>If you’re in the Forest of Dean or Monmouthshire, I’m probably your nearest library! Otherwise you can find libraries and consultants on the Sling Pages website maintained by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DrRosieKnowles/">Carrying Matters</a></p>

<h3>I need more support (or less!) - are there other services I can access?</h3>
<p>A sling library is the perfect place to try out a couple of carriers in a front or hip carry position, where there are no additional needs or considerations. However, many libraries also offer longer in depth consultation sessions, both face to face and online. Some scenarios which might require a longer consultation include wanting to carry more than one child at a time, back carrying, feeding in a carrier or wanting to try a wider variety of carriers.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you just want to pick up a carrier to borrow without attending a library session, many libraries also offer doorstep and postal hires, generally with follow up online support if needed.</p>
