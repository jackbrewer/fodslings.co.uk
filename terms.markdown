  <h2>Covid-19 Restrictions:</h2>
  <p>Due to the current Covid-19 restrictions I am not currently holding multi-household drop-in sessions. Hire carriers are available via non-contact doorstep collection from Pillowell, or during pre-booked library sessions or garden/studio consultations.</p>
  <h2>Doorstep hires:</h2>
  <p>All carriers will be laundered or stored for at least 48 hours between hires, and the drop-box sanitised between hires. However, for your own peace of mind and protection I suggest that you wait 24 hours between collection and first use of the carrier.</p>
  <h2>Sling Library sessions:</h2>
  <p>Sling library sessions will operate with pre-booked 10 minute fitting slots. Families will be able to try a maximum of 2 carriers per slot.</p>
  <p>Only one family per sling library session will be able to try each carrier. All unhired carriers will be quarantined for at least 48 hours or laundered.</p>
  <p>Please adhere to government guidance regarding Covid-19 prevention where possible, and do not attend a session if you have any Covid-19 symptoms. Should you develop symptoms during the 14 days visiting your visit please inform me immediately.</p>

  <h2>Forest of Dean Slings: Hire Agreement</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>I will use the personal information that you provide in accordance with GDPR.</li>
    <li>Return reminders will be sent by email. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have provided a valid email address.</li>
    <li>Hire fees must be paid by bank transfer in advance of doorstep collection, or in cash at drop-in sessions.</li>
    <li>When using a hired baby sling, your child’s safety is your responsibility. Misuse can cause injury to the wearer and child. Manufacturer instructions can be found on the hire page for each individual carrier. <strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using the sling correctly and that your baby or child is safe at all times when using the carrier/sling.</strong></li>
    <li>All carriers are checked before lending to ensure that they are in good condition and working order, and will be inspected on their return. It is the hirer’s responsibility to check over the carrier before every use, checking all buckles, hems and seams ensuring that there are no tears, breaks, cracks or holes. If in doubt then do not use and immediately report it to Forest of Dean Slings.</li>
    <li>Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. I suggest that, after familiarising yourself with the instructions given, you then practice using the sling with a doll/teddy or cushion/pillow so that you get used to the tying/fastening/adjusting methods. It is sensible to have another adult present on the first few occasions you put your child in the sling.</li>
    <li>The hire rate is £10 for two weeks or £15 for four weeks. Proof of address and photo ID is required for all hires. If proof of address cannot be provided a deposit will be required to the full value of the hired sling.</li>
    <li>Slings must be returned on time unless by prior agreement. I may be unable to extend a loan if there is a waiting list. Please note that it is your responsibility to return the sling to a library drop-in session or to my home address.  A late fee of £1 per day will apply to un-arranged late returns.</li>
    <li>I expect carriers to be well looked after and returned without damage or permanent staining. Please keep the carrier away from cigarette smoke and animals. You will be liable for any costs incurred for extra laundering, repairs or replacement of a carrier or accessories, with each judged on a case by case basis. In the event of any loss or damage you will be liable for any costs, and will be referred to the small claims court to recoup these if necessary.</li>
    <li>Any hires not returned or renewed within 30 days of the end of the hire period will be assumed lost, and you will be billed for the retail price of the carrier.</li>
    <li>If the sling becomes dirty please carefully spot clean using water and a soft cloth. Where spot cleaning is not possible or effective please contact the sling library for further guidance. Please do not machine or hand wash the sling without contacting me first. Suck pads can be machine washed at 30 degrees.</li>
    <li>All slings, carriers and accessories remain the property of Helen Brewer at Forest of Dean Slings at all times and all hires are subject to availability at our discretion.</li>
