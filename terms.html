          <h2>Terms and Conditions of hire</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>We will use the personal information that you provide in this form in accordance with GDPR.</li>
            <li>Manufacturers’ instructions and return reminders will be sent by email. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have provided a valid email address.</li>
            <li>Hire fees must be paid in cash. <strong><em>Gifted</em></strong> PayPal payment or bank transfer may be used <strong>subject to available internet connection at drop-ins</strong>.</li>
            <li>When using a hired baby sling, your child’s safety is your responsibility. Misuse can cause injury to the wearer and child. <strong>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using the sling correctly and that your baby or child is safe at all times when using the sling</strong>.</li>
            <li>All carriers are checked before lending to ensure that they are in good condition and working order, and will be inspected on their return. It is the hirer’s responsibility to check over the carrier before every use, checking all buckles, hems and seams ensuring that there are no tears, breaks, cracks or holes. If in doubt then do not use and immediately report it to Forest of Dean Slings.</li>
            <li>Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. We suggest that, after familiarising yourself with the instructions given, you then practice using the sling with a doll/teddy or cushion/pillow so that you get used to the tying/fastening/adjusting methods. It is sensible to have another adult present on the first few occasions you put your child in the sling.</li>
            <li>The hire rate is £10 for two weeks or £15 for four weeks. Proof of address is required for all hires. If proof of address cannot be provided a deposit will be required to the full value of the hired sling.</li>
            <li>Slings must be returned on time unless by prior agreement. We may be unable to extend a loan if we have a waiting list. <strong>Please note that it is your responsibility to return the sling to a library drop-in session</strong>. Slings may also be returned to my home address by prior arrangement.  A late fee of £1 per day will apply to unarranged late returns.</li>
            <li>We expect carriers to be well looked after and returned without damage or permanent staining beyond normal wear and tear. Please keep the carrier away from cigarette smoke and animals. You will be liable for any costs incurred for extra laundering, repairs or replacement of a carrier or accessories, with each judged on a case by case basis. In the event of any loss or damage you will be liable for any costs, and will be referred to the small claims court to recoup these if necessary.</li>
            <li>If the sling becomes dirty please carefully spot clean using water and a soft cloth. Where spot cleaning is not possible please contact the sling library for further guidance. Please do not machine or hand wash the sling.</li>
            <li>All slings, carriers and accessories remain the property of Helen Brewer at Forest of Dean Slings at all times and all hires are subject to availability at our discretion.</li>
