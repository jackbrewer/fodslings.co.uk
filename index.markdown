  <h2>Diversity, Equality and Inclusion</h2>

  <h3>Diversity</h3>
  <p>At Forest of Dean slings I want you to know, explicitly, that you are WELCOME. I am here to support you on your babywearing journey regardless of your skin colour, sexual orientation, gender identity or nationality.</p>

  <h3>Equality</h3>
  <p>Equal opportunities doesn’t mean treating everyone the same. Some people need more or different support than others. If you do have a protected or other characteristic or disability that you’d like me to be aware of, so that I can better support you on your babywearing journey, please let me know.</p>

  <h3>Inclusion</h3>
  <p>Again, please know that you are welcome here. Whether this is your first baby or your 5th, whether you’re a birth parent, biological parent, adoptive parent, fosterer, or carer. Whatever milk you feed your baby and however it’s delivered. I want you to feel comfortable and to know that this is a safe space, and that the information I provide is evidence based and judgement-free.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>Both of my sling library session venues are wheelchair accessible. Unfortunately my garden consultancy space is not accessible by wheelchair, or buggy. If you have mobility issues or other accessibility needs and require a full length consultation please do get in touch as I may be able to visit you in your own home or in an accessible public space.</p>
