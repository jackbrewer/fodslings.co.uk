  <h3>How to hire a carrier</h3>

  <p>To book a carrier for hire please <a href="https://fodslings.myturn.com/library/createUser/create">create a MyTurn user account.</a></p>

  <p>You can then browse and reserve a carrier from my <a href="/carriers">selection of available carriers</a>. If you’re not sure what sort of carrier would fit your needs please drop me an email or facebook PM to talk it through.</p>

  <p>You can collect and return your carrier via the dropbox outside my house in Pillowell, or from a pre-booked sling library session.</p>

  <p>All doorstep hires include a free 15 minute video fit check.</p>

  <h2>Fit Checks</h2>

  <p>Fit checks are available online or at pre-booked sling library sessions. These last approximately 15 minutes and are suitable for one or two carriers, with your baby in a parent-facing front carry. If you want help fitting multiple carriers or to try different carrying positions I recommend booking a private consultation.</p>

  <p>Fit checks are FREE with doorstep hires, or £3 for your own carrier. Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> to arrange yours!</p>

  <h2>Consultations</h2>

  <p>I am now offering Covid-secure, socially distanced consultations from the comfort of a cosy cabin in my garden in Pillowell, allowing you and your little one(s) the time and space to explore various carrying options.</p>

  <p>Consultations are available to book most weekends, and cost £30 for up to 90 minutes. A consultation is a great option for the following scenarios:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You want to try out several types of carrier</li>
    <li>You want to learn to back carry</li>
    <li>You want to learn to feed in a carrier</li>
    <li>You or your baby has a disability or medical condition that may affect babywearing</li>
    <li>You want to carry more than one child at once</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please note that unfortunately my garden space is not suitable for wheelchairs or buggies, and that there are several steps up to the cabin. If you have mobility issues or other accessibility needs please do get in touch as I may be able to visit you in your own home or in an accessible public space.</p>
