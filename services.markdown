  <h3>How to hire a carrier</h3>

  <p>To book a carrier for hire please <a href="https://fodslings.myturn.com/library/createUser/create">create a MyTurn user account.</a></p>

  <p>You can then browse and reserve a carrier from my <a href="/carriers">selection of available carriers</a>. If you’re not sure what sort of carrier would fit your needs please drop me an email or facebook PM to talk it through.</p>

  <p>You can collect and return your carrier from a pre-booked sling library session or via the dropbox outside my house in Pillowell.</p>

  <p>All doorstep hires include a free 15 minute video fit check.</p>

  <h2 id="sling-library-sessions">Sling Library Sessions</h2>

  <p><a href="/blog/">Sling library sessions</a> run on the first Thursday of the month at Lydney Community centre and the third Thursday of the month at Forest Humbugs Baby Group, Forest Community Church, Cinderford. These are run as baby group style events with short individual or group fitting slots of around 15 minutes each.</p>

  <p>Sling library sessions are perfect for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meeting other local families</li>
    <li>Help using your own carrier in an upright front or hip carry position</li>
    <li>Trying out one or two hire carriers in an upright front or hip carry position</li>
    <li>Learning to carry a newborn in a stretchy wrap in an upright front carry position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL, due to COVID-19 considerations and to help me know which carriers to bring on the day.</p>

  <p><a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=20371459&appointmentType=16173909">Book a slot at Lydney here</a></p>

  <p><small>£3 to attend the session, deducted from fitting and hire charges. Fittings cost £5 with your own carrier (or to try a library carrier without hiring), £3 with free newborn hires and are included with paid hires</small></p>

  <p><small>Note that you may also need to book a space at the main baby group separately, depending on their current Covid protocols.</small></p>

  </div>

  <p>If you would like help fitting multiple carriers or to try different carrying positions I recommend booking a private consultation</p>

  <p>There is no need to book if you are returning a hire carrier but not stopping for the session.</p>

  <h2 id="video-fit-checks">Video Fit Checks</h2>

  <p>Online video fit checks are available FREE OF CHARGE for all doorstep hires, and cost £5 for your own carrier. These last approximately 15 minutes and are suitable for one or two carriers, with your baby in an upright parent-facing front carry. If you want help fitting multiple carriers or to try different carrying positions I recommend booking a private consultation.</p>

  <h2 id="consultations">Consultations</h2>

  <p>I am now offering Covid-secure, socially distanced consultations from the comfort of a cosy cabin in my garden in Pillowell, allowing you and your little one(s) the time and space to explore various carrying options.</p>

  <p>Consultations are available to book most weekends, and cost £30 for up to 90 minutes. A consultation is a great option for the following scenarios:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You want to try out several types of carrier</li>
    <li>You want to learn to back carry</li>
    <li>You want to learn to feed in a carrier</li>
    <li>You or your baby has a disability or medical condition that may affect babywearing</li>
    <li>You want to carry more than one child at once</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=20371459&appointmentType=29510728">book a consultation here</a>. If you’d like to book a consultation outside my usual bookable hours, please email me to discuss availability.</p>

  <p>Please note that unfortunately my garden space is not suitable for wheelchairs or buggies, and that there are several steps up to the cabin. If you have mobility issues or other accessibility needs please do get in touch as I may be able to visit you in your own home or in an accessible public space.</p>
