  <h3>How to hire a carrier</h3>

  <p>To book a carrier for hire please <a href="https://fodslings.myturn.com/library/createUser/create">create a MyTurn user account.</a></p>

  <p>You can then browse and reserve a carrier from my <a href="/carriers">selection of available carriers</a>. If you’re not sure what sort of carrier would fit your needs please drop me an email or facebook PM to talk it through.</p>

  <p>You can collect and return your carrier from a pre-booked sling library session or via the dropbox outside my house in Pillowell.</p>

  <p>All doorstep hires include a free 15 minute video fit check.</p>

  <h2 id="sling-library-sessions">Sling Library Sessions</h2>

  <p><a href="/blog/">Sling library sessions</a> run on the first Friday of the month at Lydney Community centre. These are run as baby group style events with short individual or group fitting slots of around 15 minutes each.</p>

  <p>Sling library sessions are perfect for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meeting other local families</li>
    <li>Help using your own carrier in an upright front or hip carry position</li>
    <li>Trying out one or two hire carriers in an upright front or hip carry position</li>
    <li>Learning to carry a newborn in a stretchy wrap in an upright front carry position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Booking is recommended to help me know which carriers to bring on the day.</p>

  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2paKbogzIePGzT1TAxJ_mUskEHonqjtMGepQ3qooCpqv1Og/viewform">Book a slot at Lydney here</a></p>

  <p><small>£3 to attend the session, deducted from fitting and hire charges. Fittings cost £5 with your own carrier (or to try a library carrier without hiring), £3 with free newborn hires and are included with paid hires</small></p>
  
  <p>There is no need to book if you are returning a hire carrier but not stopping for the session.</p>

  <h2 id="video-fit-checks">Video Fit Checks</h2>

  <p>Online video fit checks are available free of charge for all doorstep hires. These last up to 15 minutes and are suitable for one carrier, with your baby in an upright parent-facing front carry.</p>

  <h2 id="consultations">Consultations</h2>

  <p>I have very limited availability for private consultations, but may be able to offer these in particular circumstances where I can't provide sufficient support in a group setting, such as for babies or carers with additional needs or medical conditions. These can be held in my cosy garden cabin, or I can come to you. If you’d like to book a consultation please email me to discuss availability.</p>

  <p>Please note that unfortunately my home consultation space is not suitable for wheelchairs or buggies, and that there are several steps up to the cabin. If you have mobility issues or other accessibility needs please do get in touch as I may be able to visit you in your own home or in an accessible public space.</p>
